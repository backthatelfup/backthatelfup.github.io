- title: "Mythos Expeditions"
  anchor: "ppme"
  tagline: "Professor Henry Rutherford Stapleton of the Miskatonic Department of Anthropology is just west of Chichen Itza, working with local Maya people and a few university students at what he calls the Cenote of El-Thar. He is loath to leave his work behind as he has fostered a relationship with the locals and reports he is on the verge of making a very important discovery. To the northwest, ethnolinguist Galina Avenirovna Prokhorov is studying glyphs found in the Temple of the Jaguar King, suggesting it has some connection with the cenote Stapleton is studying. Hurricane season is drawing to a close and Stapleton has requested several more students to aid him in investigating and dredging the cenotes, ruins, and vibrant villages on the Yucatan peninsula."
  blurb: "The Mythos Expeditions are a collection of adventures for Trail of Cthulhu, designed to be run as a stand alone with new rules tailored for expeditions or as part of the Armitage Files campaign setting in the core rules. Tristan wrote the module The Jaguars of El-Thar."
