Hey hey hey!

GUESS WHAT?

JEREMY WHITLEY IS DOING A PRINCELESS ANTHOLOGY. 

Who is [Jeremy Whitley](https://about.me/jeremywhitley) and what is [Princeless](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1939352541/?tag=bathelup-20)? Jeremy is the writer and creator of this super fun, sword slinging tale of Princess Adrienne who has had enough of the world’s patriarchal bologna and strikes out with her dragon and best bud Bedelia to set things right. It’s a super funny, all ages comic with muscle and heart.

Jeremy Whitley is doing a Princeless Anthology where the proceeds will go to help [Girls Leadership Institute](http://girlsleadership.org/) and [Girls Rock NC](http://www.girlsrocknc.org/), two great organizations that empower young women and girls in his home state of North Carolina. It wouldn’t be an anthology without a list of awesome people working on it and this one is no exception, with talented creators like Kelly Sue Deconnick, Gail Simone, Mikki Kendall, Kimya Dawson and **mooooooreincludingMEEEEEEEE**.

YEAH. I AM IN THIS ANTHOLOGY. 

I am working with the wonderful G. Pike of [Title Unrelated](http://www.titleunrelated.com/) to bring you an original story with a new character to the Princeless universe! Whoa! Oh my glob! How cool is that?

As we get closer to its release I will definitely let you know how to get your hands on what I know will be a super rad book! If you’re unfamiliar with Princeless, Valiant is actually printing out a hardcover collection of the book so you can scoop it all up really quick. Alternately, you can find it in your local comics shop and on Comixology!
