## Steven Universe Ice Cream Flavors!
What are two things I love? Ice cream and Steven Universe. We have a really good local ice cream shop in our neighborhood which crafts really amazing, delicious flavors like passionfruit sorbet and chocolate stout ice cream. I also love the character design and colors of Steven Universe, in addition to the great storytelling that happens and the fun music.

Thinking about the two things I love, I thought, how could I combine ice cream and Steven Universe? And here's what I came up with.

* **Pearl:** Lemon-lychee sorbet w/ a honey swirl. 
* **Amethyst:** Taro ice cream w/ marshmallows & macadamia nuts!
* **Garnet:** Strawberry & Blueberry ice cream, swirled together w/ chunks of real fruit & malt balls. Get two scoops!
* **Steven:** strawberry cheesecake ice cream with chocolate chunks! And waffles!
* **Lapis:** Seaberry lime sorbet with salted dried blueberries.
* **Rose Quartz:** White honey ice cream with candied rose petals.

All Crystal Gems ice creams come with pop rocks, of course :D

What do you think, would you eat these? What flavors would you come up with?
