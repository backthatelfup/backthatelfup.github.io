tagline: "22 cards…each an individual splinter of the human psyche. 22 writers…honing each splinter into a story of triumph and decay, arrogance and humility. <br />Stories of the brightest lights and the darkest corners of the weirdest minds. 22 cross-genre worlds. 22 portals into the Universal. Only one way to get there. Come with us. Cross the portals. The Universal awaits."
