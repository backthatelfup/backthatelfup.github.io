anchor: "bb"
tagline: "Tristan J. Tarwater breaks into new territory with a bold vision of terror that combines the disorienting cosmic horror of Lovecraft with the modern sensibility of the urban streets."
blurb: "As a former soldier and police consultant, Luis Quintana has seen the horrors of war and the brutality of crime on the streets. But when a ritualistic mass murder links an old friend to a lurking supernatural terror, Quintana must uncover a truth he’d thought long hidden, and face a horror he thought he’d long escaped."
