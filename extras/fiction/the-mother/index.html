It was ripe, perfect for tonight’s supper. Rish loved papaya. Eriza would serve it with honey, sprinkled with the crushed, black seeds after the main course. She would save some of the seeds for tomorrow’s stew for the temple. The baby strapped to her back cooed as she paid for the fruit, dropping the metal coins into the merchant’s hand. Like his father, Rishin had a fondness for fruits and sweets.</p> <p>Eriza placed the ripe fruit in her basket and continued down the street, unfazed by the humid, tropical air. The Port of Hitha was her home and the capitol of Miz. A bustling coastal city, the Eye of the Islands, she enjoyed the amenities the city allowed her. The streets were clean and well kept, lit even at night. The people were well protected by the well trained and efficient Hithan Police Force. And from this street she could see the towering spires of the School of Saint Bariz. One day Rishin would have his hair braided and he would be allowed to walk through the carved arches, to learn from the white and blue robed teachers. If he was a good student and showed promise in one of the disciplines, he would shave his head and join the ranks of those who have devoted their adolescence to learning. It was what she and her husband both hoped for their son.</p> <p>For now Rishin wiggled at her back and smacked his lips hungrily so Eriza saved her happy daydreams for after supper. The sun was heading into the Goddess’ Bag, to be reborn the next day and supper and offertory meals needed to be cooked. Eriza tightened the kerchief about her head and walked down the street, singing quietly as thoughts of home drifted through her head. Other merchants and a hairdresser worked in the dwindling sunlight, almost ready to close up for the day.</p> <p>A cold breeze ruffled her kerchief and her dress, the coldest breeze she had ever felt. That was strange, she thought, frowning as another gust came from behind her. Eriza shivered as she continued down the street but a scream made her turn, her eyes growing wide before she threw up a hand to shield them.</p> <p>In the middle of the street a light was glowing, icy blue and undulating, sending gusts of cold air through the market. Paper scattered and tent flaps shook as people shouted and watched, waiting to see what would happen. The icy blue light flashed and flashed again, almost dazzling Eriza. And then it grew.</p> <p>A group of blue skinned people blinked into being, dressed in white furs. They seemed to be walking in place, something white and fluffy blowing past them in a strong wind. One of the blue skinned ones turned and set its eyes on Eriza. The strange eyes were icy blue and colder than a winter sea. In the person’s hand was a whip of black leather. Turning its face away, Eriza saw what walked before them. Not animals but people. Half naked, chained with silver shackles, their skin was as white as seashells. Their faces were miserable, and scarred. The wind grew colder and Eriza dropped her basket to the ground, clutching her arms around her.</p> <p>And then she heard it. The cry, the cry of an infant, shrill and almost drowned out by the howling wind. A pale baby cried at the chest of its mother. As the baby cried, Eriza’s own baby cried and she saw the mother clutch the baby tighter to her chest, her face screwed with fear. The figure with the black whip approached the woman and raised its arm. Black leather left a trail of scarlet on the mother’s white skin. The mother’s cries joined the high shriek of the wind.</p> <p>Her blood was red.</p> <p>The image froze but the cold wind still blew. Eriza pulled Rishin out of his carrier to comfort him, his beautiful brown face covered in tears. She held him to her chest, shielding him from the bright light and the cold wind.</p> <p>”What you have seen here is real,” came a voice from the image of the bedraggled woman and child, the cold blue figure standing over them. “The image has been transported here from the cold lands of Frid. This woman is real. Her child is real. The giant is real. Her blood is real. Please, help us.”</p> <p>The image shimmered and then blinked out, a final burst of ice cold wind shooting through the marketplace, evoking screams other watchers. And then it was gone. Eriza couldn’t help but shiver as she clutched her child. More than the cold, the image had cut her to the bone.</p> <p><em>The story continues in part 2 <a href="http://backthatelfup.com/extras/fiction/the-detective/">&#8216;The Detective&#8217;</a>.</em></p> </div> </div> <footer> <div class="sharing"> <a href="//twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://backthatelfup.github.io/extras/fiction/the-mother/index.html" data-via="backthatelfup" data-counturl="http://backthatelfup.github.io/extras/fiction/the-mother/index.html">Tweet</a> <div class="g-plusone" data-size="medium"></div> <div class="fb-like" data-send="true" data-width="450" data-show-faces="false"></div> </div> </footer> </article> <section> <h1>Comments</h1> <div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> </div> </section> </div> </div> </div> <footer role="contentinfo"><div class="text-center copyright"> Some Rights Reserved | <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a> | Powered by <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> & <a href="https://github.com/annejohnson/octofound">Octofound</a> </div> </footer> <script type="text/javascript">
