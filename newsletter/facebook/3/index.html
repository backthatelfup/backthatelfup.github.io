          <h2>Thieves at Heart (The Valley of Ten Crescents #1)</h2>
	  <p>As an orphaned half-elf in a city of humans Tavera lives in a world where she doesn't belong - until a cunning thief named Derk catches her trying to steal from him and takes her on as his apprentice.</p>

          <p>Thievery comes easy to Tavera but Derk soon becomes more than a mentor - he is the first family she's ever known - and the lessons of a father are much more difficult to learn.</p>

          <p>When Tavera discovers that Derk belongs to a secret society of elite thieves she is determined to join their ranks, but first she must prove her skills and gain their trust, and not everyone is ready to accept the young outsider.</p>

          <p>Can the group of thieves be trusted, what kind of life awaits, and what is the true cost of being one of the thieves at heart?</p>
