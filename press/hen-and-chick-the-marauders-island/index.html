    <p><strong>Author Quote:</strong> I didn’t want to do another fantasy story full of European backdrops and orphans.</p>
    <p><strong>Author Info:</strong> Tristan J. Tarwater is an author of speculative fiction, comics and RPGs. She resides in Portland, OR.</p>
    <p><strong>Book Info:</strong> Azria, a mage of Miz, is the key to revealing a long lost treasure trove: at least that’s what her mother, alleged pirate Captain Apzana says. Generations ago, THE MARAUDERS’ ISLAND was sunk by the greatest mage in Mizian history, Iyzani, as an act of war and revenge. If Azria can undo the magic of powerful mages who came before her, a vast treasure will be theirs for the taking. But more mysteries than riches surface as Azria approaches a part of Miz’ history meant to remain drowned by the waves. Those who would stop her warn her: reveal the past and destroy the lives of mages forever. Azria must decide if she will be the daughter her mother needs or protect her homeland’s secret.</p>
    <p>HEN &amp; CHICK: The Marauders’ Island is a swashbuckling fantasy story, where a wizard of immense talent and legacy must find her own place in the World of Mun. The power to control the elements is trumped by long grudges, old lies, and personal desires. Magic is for the bold, and surviving the ambitions of the powerful isn’t for the feint of heart.</p>
