    <h1> Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices for scottmarlowe.com. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by this web site. It will notify you of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the web site, how it is used and with whom it may be shared.</li>
        <li>What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.</li>
        <li>The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.</li>
        <li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reader friendly / short version</h2>
    <h2>Google Analytics</h2>
    <p>Google anayltics uses cookies to show me demographic data and user behavior on the site. It will tell me, for example, how many people came to my site from Facebook or visited on a mobile device. I never get individual information, like Suzy Q. visited on her Apple iPhone. I get numbers, just so I can see how I am drawing traffic to my site. I use this data to make my site better for its frequent users (making sure it’s mobile friendly, rendering correctly, etc).</p>

    <p>If you are at all concerned about your browsing behavior being used by Google, please consider their opt-out options here: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a></p>

    <h2>Facebook Ads</h2>
    <p>My site includes use of the Facebook pixel which can be used to serve you ads on your social media based on your browsing behavior. Facebook’s pixel also helps me be better about any advertising I send out to make sure it only goes to people who are interested in what I have to offer. :) Neither Facebook, nor I, want to spam anyone, of course. Again, like other tracking software, I never get individual information or data, just group data to see trends.</p>

    <p>Also, though I use Facebook’s ad services, I am not an employee of Facebook nor do I have any affiliation with their company. They also have no affiliation with the content on this site.</p>

    <p>If you want to opt out of Facebook ads, visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> and manage the companies you receive advertising from. You will need to do this, though, for each browser.</p>
    
    <h2>Amazon Affiliates</h2>
    <p>When you click a link on this site and it takes you to Amazon, I am using an affiliate link. This is a link that allows Amazon to pay me a small commission (about 4-8%) on the items you purchased on Amazon. I do not work for Amazon, nor do they approve or have any affiliation with the content here. They are merely rewarding me for driving traffic to their site. Again, I am not given any individual information, I don’t get names or emails, nothing like that. My reports show me what items were purchased from referrals on my site and what I’m getting paid. Affiliate monies earned do not affect your price or cost on Amazon, it’s paid entirely by Amazon.</p>
