    <h1>Tristan J. Tarwater</h1>
    <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Tristan and I'm a novelist, comic book writer, and freelance RPG writer. I used to write the weekly column 'Reality Makes the Best Fantasy' for the roleplaying site Troll in the Corner.</p>
    <p>As a fan of speculative fiction the first fantasy book I fell in love with was The Crystal Cave.</p>
    <p>Originally hailing from New York City, I consider Portland, OR my home and reside with my spouse, Small Boss, a cat that knows itâ€™s a Multipass and Azrael.</p>
