   <h1>Self-Made Scoundrel</h1>
   <h2 class="subheader">The Valley of Ten Crescents #2</h2>
   <p>Dershik Cartaskin's life is one of power, wealth, privilege... and lies. Son to an ambitious father, husband to a wife he cannot love, and father to a child who is not his own, Dershik has everything, and yet nothing to call his own.  When the price of power and the weight of lies grow too great for him to bear, Dershik decides to leave everything he's ever known behind, and makes a deadly choice that will irrevocably alter his future.</p>
   <p>Rejecting his former life, Dershik takes on a new name and a new identity, and sets out to forge his legacy as Derk -- member of the band of thieves known as the Cup of Cream, and SELF-MADE SCOUNDREL. But soon Derk finds that even a dishonest man can't hide from the truth...</p>
   <p><em>In this prequel to THIEVES AT HEART, author Tristan Tarwater (BOTANICA BLUES, LITTLE GIRL LOST) tells the story of Derk, the man who changed Tavera's life forever.</em></p>
