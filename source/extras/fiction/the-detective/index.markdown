<h1>Miz</h1>
<h2 class="subheader">The Detective</h2>
	
<p><em>This is the second story of Miz. You can read part 1 'The Mother' <a href="http://backthatelfup.com/extras/fiction/the-mother/">here</a>.</em>
<p>Detective Zesh Bwadne knocked on the door. He waited for the door to open, waited for the reaction. After a few moments the green door did open and there it was. A man with a closely trimmed beard and dark eyes answered the door, his eyes widening as they darted over him. It was the uniform, it was the number of officers standing behind Bwadne on the man’s doorstep, their cloaks fluttering in the tropical evening air.</p> 

<p>“Detective Bwadne,” he said. “I’m here investigating the incidents which took place yesterday afternoon on Grocery Street. Is Eriza Gedne home? We have some questions for her.” The man looked to Bwadne’s belt and the detective could see him swallow hard. The man saw the weapon in its holster. A police issued mace, fashioned of steel and magically enhanced to send charges of force on command, able to knock people to the ground with a word. Not just any officer could carry one of these. Not that it was the most powerful weapon in his arsenal.</p> 

<p>“She’s inside,” the man said, stepping out of the doorway. “Please, come in.” Detective Bwadne nodded and entered the home, the other three officers following after him. He removed the wide brimmed, conical hat which was part of the uniform, handing it to one of his accompanying officers. The other three kept theirs on.</p> 

<p>A woman was nursing a baby and reading from a book, her hair already tied up for the evening. “Eriza,” the man said. She looked up from her book and now her eyes grew wide with surprise. “A detective is here to see you,” the man said. He sounded concerned.</p> 

<p>“I’m sorry for the late hour, Madame Gedne,” the detective said. He meant it. They had spent the entire day interviewing the people in the report. The Gedne family happened to be last on the list, as they lived the farthest from the crime scene. “But we’ve been investigating the incident that happened on Grocer Street yesterday afternoon and the grocer said you were there. I wanted to ask you a few questions.”</p> 

<p>“Of course,” she said. She shifted in her seat so she faced the detective. “Any way I can help.” He looked around the house. It was a simple home, typical of the area. Her husband was obviously a farmer. His hands and the tools leaning against the door told the detective that. His name was Rish, by all accounts. Her husband wasn’t from the city. Eriza was a younger daughter of a cloth merchant. She had more education than her spouse and more than a few relatives at the Spires. Right now though, she looked like any other Mizian woman getting ready for bed.</p> 

<p>“Can you confirm you were there when the incident took place?” Detective Bwadne asked, pulling out his wax tablet and stylus. Her husband sat down on one of the cushions. He was obviously concerned about the incident but more worried about his wife. The man kept his eyes on his wife and the baby at her breast as the three officers walked about the home.</p> 

<p>Eriza nodded. “I was there, buying supper. Did you find out what happened to those people?”</p> 

<p>The Detective held his hand up to stop her from asking any more questions. He was there to get answers. “Can you tell me in your own words what happened?”</p> 

<p>The woman nodded, looking off to the side as she began to recollect her thoughts. The child she cradled thrust a fist into the air and she took it, playing with his small fingers as he cooed and smacked his lips. “I had just bought a papaya from Hish the grocer and was walking back toward home when I felt a cold wind,” she began. “It was so cold I started to walk faster but then people started to scream so I turned to see what it was. That’s when I saw it.”</p> 

<p>“Saw what, Madame Gedne?”</p> 

<p>“A…sphere. A sphere of light and…wind was coming from it. It was so cold.” The woman shivered as she unlatched the baby and laid him across her lap, patting him on the back. “It was magic, wasn’t it?”</p> 

<p>“Correct, Madame.” He could tell her that much. It was obvious. “What happened next?” One of the other officers was looking over their bookshelf. A decent number of books made up the collection, of various sizes and lengths. The officer picked one up and flipped through it.</p> 

<p>“I…watched the ball of light. I was too scared to move.” The woman looked to the side, furrowing her brows at the officers poking through their belongings. “And then it went from being a ball to an image. I saw those people. The blue ones and a woman being whipped. A woman with a child.”</p> 

<p>“It must have been very upsetting,” Detective Bwadne said, writing her words down in shorthand on the tablet. “Did you happen to notice anything out of place or strange before the light happened? Anyone at the marketplace that shouldn’t have been there?”</p> 

<p>The woman shook her head. “No, just people buying food. Selling.” She paused for a moment, her brow furrowing on her dark face. “There was a hairdresser there.”</p> 

<p>“Did he have any clients?” A hairdresser? He tried to keep his voice flat, his breathing steady. The hairdresser had been mentioned by several people as being peculiar.</p> 

<p>“Only one, I think?” she offered. The baby belched, its head jerking upward as it did. The woman cradled the baby again, her husband coming forward to take the baby from her and put him in the small hammock strung across their bed. The woman pulled her shawl around her tighter, as if she was cold. “The hairdresser was a woman.”</p> 

<p>“And the client?” the detective asked, raising a brow. The officer that had been looking through the book turned their head toward them.</p> 

<p>“A man. A….” her voice trailed off as she tried to remember. “He was getting his head shaved. A few cycles younger than me. He was wearing blue and white robes. Only two whorls on his stole.”</p> 

<p>A student of the third spire? Getting his head shaved? Detective Bwadne made a note. “And the hairdresser?”</p> 

<p>“She was wearing a wig. It was…blue? It was blue.” She nodded. “Older than me, maybe a hand’s width taller?”</p> 

<p>They had found blue hairs at the crime scene, not blown away by the wind. He glanced over at the other officers, raising his eyebrows. According to the grocer, the hairdresser had only set up shop there a few days ago. They’d get the market registrations and he’d see to her interrogation himself. He and Fowde.</p> 

<p>“I think we’ve got everything we need, Madame Gedne,” he said. He put the cover on his tablet and tucked the stylus into his belt, keeping his face calm as he gestured for the other police to head to the door. “Thank you for your time, your city thanks you.”</p> 

<p>“When is the Grand Council going to look into helping Frid?” She stood up and walked with them as they headed toward the door. “I want to sit in on the hearing.”</p> 

<p>The detective stopped in his tracks. There it was. Regardless of whether they found the violators or not, the damage had been done. That had been the point of it all. He turned around and faked a smile, bowing his head as he answered her. “I can assure you, we are doing all that we can to see  this matter is resolved, Madame Gedne.” He took his hat and left with his fellow officers before she could ask any more questions.</p> 

<p>The four of them walked into the alley, away from the homes. A cool breeze was blowing in from the ocean and the nighttime sounds of the residential quarter were quiet, peaceful. People were going to bed while it was cool. A stray chicken out for a walk crossed their path, pecking at the ground. Bwadne put his hat on his head before he looked to the female officer who was his partner. “Are we clear?”</p> 

<p>She pulled off her hat and pulled the two ivory sticks out of her hair. Thick, beaded locks spilled down and over her shoulders and she scratched at her scalp as she scanned around with dark eyes. “Yes, clear.” Bwadne smirked. It was hard keeping all that hair under the hat. But it was a dead giveaway Arza Fowde was a magic user. In some investigations it was good to have the leverage of the magewoman on his side but for interviews, it could be intimidating and steer the answers. Asking questions and reading people was a delicate art form. It was Bwadne’s own form of magic.</p> 

<p>“What was the status of the home?” he asked.</p> 

<p>“Hotter than I anticipated,” she said. “But nothing illegal. Inherited items. A book of ancestral magics that was pretty interesting but I doubt she realizes what she’s got.” Fowde looked to the side as a giant moth flitted across the alley, fluttering loudly in the humid air. “Just a bystander.”</p> 

<p>“And the hairdresser? What do you make of that?” Bwadne asked. He knew the answer Fowde would give him.</p> 

<p>“Hairdressing isn’t illegal,” Chiwde said. He was a young officer, new to the profession and still with a lot to learn. The young man looked up to Bwadne, he knew that. Bwadne knew the force needed all the good detectives it could get and if he had anything to do with it, Chiwde would be one of them. Chiwde knew the written rules. He had a few more to learn.</p> 

<p>“Hairdressing isn’t illegal but hair is not a spell component in Mizian magic.” Fowde started walking down the street and Bwadne fell in beside her, letting the rookies follow behind. “The hairdresser is the only peculiar part of this, the hairdresser and the student she was working on.”</p> 

<p>“If the hairdresser is the magic user, she’s performed an unauthorized act and may have obtained forged permits to set up the fake hairdressing practice.” This came from Dwine. The country girl too clever to remain in her village, with everything to prove. She walked with her hands behind her back all the time and her eyes rarely missed a detail. In truth, Bwadne loved her intensity. She reminded him of a cat, staring, its tail flicking back and forth before it pounced. “At the very least, once we get a hold of her we can detain her for that. The freshly shaved student’s a cover. But one of them has either access to the Classified Magic section of the Spires or would have had to have spent years out of Miz, studying other magics.” Dwine could take it all in. She knew where to strike. Her mind was a precision instrument. Her intense eyes and unsmiling mouth both narrowed. It bothered her, the betrayal of their city and customs. </p> 

<p>“There’s another option too,” Chiwde spoke up. They all looked to him and waited. The young man gulped, obviously nervous to have so many eyes on him. “Well…what is the magic user wasn’t from Hitha? Or Miz? What if someone from Frid somehow got here?”</p> 

<p>An illegal immigrant? Who was practicing another path of magic? Bwadne looked to Fowde. “Is it possible?”</p> 

<p>Fowde’s face told him it was and that she didn’t like the idea. She narrowed her eyes and put her hat on, not bothering to tuck her hair back under it this time. “I’ll check the records for peculiar magic surges that were never resolved. We’re dealing with a big fish if they whisked in, even bigger if they got past the customs officials.” Fowde looked to Dwine. “You, come with me. You’ve an eye for detail.”</p> 

<p>“I’ll take Chiwde about Scholar Street. Change the search a bit.” Bwadne grinned at his partner, putting his hat on his head. “I’ll make the report. You get to the Spires.”</p> 

<p>“You heading to the bar after shift?” Fowde asked. A breeze kicked up and their cloaks fluttered in the wind. The wind smelled of heady flowers and evening fires. Bwadne shook his head.</p> 

<p>“Nah, barracks for me. And you two'll do the same, if you’re smart. This case is a big one. We’ll be up before the lantern fish go down.” He nodded in farewell to his partner and the other female officer before he and Chiwde turned and headed back toward Grocer Street.</p> 

<p>“Thanks for bringing me along, Detective Bwadne.” Bwadne laughed out loud. He saw Chiwde look down at the ground, obviously embarrassed. Bwadne slapped him on the back.</p> 

<p>“Last I checked you were on the payroll, Chiwde,” Bwadne smiled. “And…just Bwadne.” Chiwde’s face brightened. He was so young. Just as Bwadne had been when he first joined the force. Bwadne served out of choice, like Chiwde. Not like Fowde. Fowde, as a student of the Third Spire had to fulfill her obligation. Training was traded for service. Bright eyed and eager to help, that was Chiwde. He just had to get a little self-confidence and he could be a good detective. “I want you to pay attention to the types of questions I ask and who I ask, got it? Keep an eye on their faces. I need you to take it in.”</p> 

<p>“Why’re we going back to Scholar Street though?”</p> 

<p>“If we’ve got an outsider, an outsider will need an insider to get things for them. They’re working with another magic user. They have to be. Someone will have noticed something unusual. It’s late, people are tired and they’ll just want to go home. All we have to do is show our faces, bring it up and they’ll keep an eye out for us. And if someone is hiding something, it’ll be harder to hide if they’re too tired to hide it. We’ll hit Sea Corner for a few questions with a man I know.” Bwadne had a flea on the dog, an informer on the inside no one else knew about. If another outsider was making trouble with magic, Yarik the Yellow would know something. He was sure of it.</p> 

<p>“The important thing,” Bwadne started. He breathed in deep, inhaling the smells of Hitha, his home. “Is this. Someone is disturbing the peace of our city, our country and our homeland. We have to keep the people safe. And part of being safe is feeling safe. Do not forget it.” The young officer nodded somberly. Bwadne nodded and kept his eyes focused ahead of him, ready to do what he had to do in order to protect his fellow citizens.</p>
