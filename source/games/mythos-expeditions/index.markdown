<p>An unstable anthropologist in the wilds of Mayan Yucatan. The prestige (and expedition budget) of Miskatonic’s Mayan studies program is on the line, in a remote province thrown into turmoil by Depression, rebellion, and the return of unwelcome outsiders. Riffs off the Mayan “Caste War” ending in April 1933, as well as another event that year that might spoil the adventure if I revealed it here.</p>
<p><em>Gumshoe is an investigation-based RPG system developed by Robin D. Laws and Kenneth Hite.  When Tristan was asked to contribute an adventure to Mythos Expeditions, she couldn't say no.</em></p>
