    <p>Hen and Chick is a monthly serialized story.</p>
    <em>Azria, a mage of Miz, is the the key to revealing a long lost treasure: at least that’s what her mother, alleged pirate Captain Apzana says. If Azria can undo the magic of powerful mages who came before her, a vast treasure will be theirs for the taking. But more mysteries than riches surface as Azria approaches a fortune tied to a part of Miz’ history meant to remain drowned by the waves. Those who would stop her warn her: reveal the past and destroy the lives of mages forever. Azria must decide if she will be the daughter her mother needs or protect her homeland’s secret. </em>
